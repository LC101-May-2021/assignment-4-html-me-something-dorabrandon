               <h3>Jake "From StateFarm" </h3>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Jake was born in February, 2014. It just happens that the popular Jake &quot;From StateFarm&quot; commercials were the hype at the moment... so that's where this puppy got his name. He is currently 7 years old. He used to love running around the tree in the backyard and barking a everything. He loves going on walks, chasing cars and fighting with BlackBeard. </p>

               <h3>Diego Butt</h3>
               <p class = "funParagraph">Diego is a mix. I can't remember of what. He's a very smart dog, but doesn't really like men. We only had Diego for about a year or two. Diego and Jake didn't get along, but my cousin (from Milwaukee) loved Diego, so she and her wife decided to take him in. He's been very happy with them and I get to visit anytime I want. He's become very strong and knows so many tricks! I love seeing how big he's gotten.</p>

               <h3>Riley</h3>
               <p class = "funParagraph">Riley was born in February of 2019. He's still a puppy to me. He's much smaller than Jake and loves being by my side any chance he gets. He's scared of everything, but he will back at everything too, just never get close to it. He loves to run and bark and play and is a very picky eater. Riley also likes to hog the bed.</p>

               <p class = "funParagraph">BlackBeard is my boyfriend's cat. I don't like cats (they scare me, they look evil), but she has grown on my and I love her! I dont think she liked me at first, but she's warmed up to me. When she was a kitten, she climbed to the neighbor's house and fell into a tub of motor oil. She had tobe scrubbed with Dawn, and well you know how cats love water! </p>
